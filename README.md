## Single Fiber Gigabit Media Converter

**Bi-directional Gigabit Ethernet transmission over a single fiber strand.**

- Converts 1000Base-T copper Ethernet to optical fiber using a single fiber (simplex) link  
- Employs WDM technology (Tx 1310 nm / Rx 1550 nm or reverse) for simultaneous transmit and receive  
- Provides up to 20 km or more of transmission distance over single-mode fiber  
- Reduces cabling cost while maintaining Gigabit performance and reliability  

Perfect for data centers, enterprise LANs, and building-to-building links where efficient fiber utilization is critical.
